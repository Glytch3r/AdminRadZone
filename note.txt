going to add the mapsymbol feature now
should probably add a way for them to disable cuz it might cause lag

sandboxoptions translation DONE

note DONT FORGET TO DOUBLE CHECK SERVER CLIENT SEND COMMANDS EVER AGAIN 

fucking figured it out god damn
fuck what a strange bug

TODO
dont forget to test small radius vs big radius isOutOfBound returns

 yellows are all variable that are live 
cooldown is the actual time during cooldown that counts down 
as it reaches 0 duration will be set from 0 to the sandbox duration (red)
then its the same 
as soon as duration hits 0 cooldown will be set 
so when cooldown is >0 then status is on cooldown
when duration is > 0 then the radiation zone is moving radius -1 per second based on custom Events "OnClockUpdate"
apply actually sets the rounds and the radius to the AdminRadZoneData

total time revised to  FUCKING TOOK ME LONG ENOUGH TO NOTICE THIS which is why it wasnt balanced
total time = (rounds * cooldown - 1) + (rounds * duration)

total time old
total time = (rounds * cooldown) + (rounds * duration)


pause and play changes its text depending on what the status is - done

re applied shrinkrate
removed shrink rate
shrinkrate is auto computed based on the number of rounds , and radius, this can be done since we know everything moves per real life seconds

status:
Paused - prevents the duration and the cooldown from getting reduced, also prevents the radius from shrinking system is basically on halt
cooldown - prevents circle from shrinking 
inactive - marker isnt showing, variables are ready 
active - actively moving as normal. radius is shrinking , and either cooldwon or duration gets -1 

buttons
clear button clears the marker and re initiatlize the data using AdminRadZone.clear()
apply - simply sends the variables to the server sends marker x and y not player x and yellow
select square - uses marker x and y now copies current player x and yellow then send sync 
teleport - simple teleports character to the AdminRadZone.Marker x and y


notice the timer functions DONE

it should be that 
when state is active radius is decreased by shrinkrate
and duration is added +1 till it reaches its sandboxoption duration
and then it will become cooldown state
so cooldown will gain from 0 its sandbox option
we also reduce our rounds by 1
it will now decrease and the duration and radius stops changing while cooldwon
if cooldown becomes 0 then we change back to active state

this is done till rounds becomes 0
and then it will hit pause state

shrink rate is dynamic it basically computes the number of rounds and cooldown based and duration 
so for example (default values)
cooldown is set to 60 and duration is also set to 60
then we have 5 rounds 
so thats 
totaltime =(rounds * duration) +( rounds - 1 * cooldown) 
totaltime = (5*60 )+ (5-1 *60)
remainingTime is now a value we subtract -1 
we are running the functions via custom luaevent OnClockUpdate
which is 1 tick per second in real life 
so you can now determine the remaining time and total time easily

TODO fix the logic DONE
note that when an admin using the panel modify any variable it wont cause error
